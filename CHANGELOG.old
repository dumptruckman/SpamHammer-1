Version 1.7b
    Now has option to not use permissions and instead use OP only for the commands.  This will allow for greater compatability.

Version 1.7a
    No longer considers all commands for spam blocking by default.  Added spammable command list to config where you should add commands that could be considered spam.

Version 1.6
    Added back repeat message block as a default option.

Version 1.5a
    Added bukkit permissions support.

Version 1.4
    Added config option (default: true) to prevent messages over the limit from appearing.  This will allow for non-punishment solutions.
    
Version 1.3b
    Disabling certain punishments no longer breaks the ones still enabled.
    Because this plugin could break features of BukkitContrib, players with the BC client mod on a server with the BC plugin will not be affected.
    
Version 1.3a
    SpamHammer now additionally picks up command usage to prevent using chat commands as a work-around.

Version 1.2
    Modified the way the plugin detects spam... Now works faster and more effectively.
    Changed the config options.

Version 1.1
    Plugin actually works now.  Silly me.
    Added a message option for the cool off timer.
    Added spamunban command to unban players banned by SpamHammer.
    Added spamunmute command to unmute players muted by SpamHammer.
    Added spamreset command to reset the level of punish a player is at.

Version 1.0
    Initial Release!
